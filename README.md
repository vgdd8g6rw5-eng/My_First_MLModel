# Predicting Molecular Solubility – Beginner ML Project

This project was built in Google Colab as a guided tutorial to better understand
how a machine learning model is trained and evaluated.

The goal was to predict molecular solubility values using numerical features
from a provided dataset.

## What This Project Focused On

- Loading and exploring a dataset
- Separating features and target variables
- Performing a train/test split
- Training a regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluating model performance using standard metrics

---

## Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## What I Learned

- How a basic supervised learning pipeline is structured
- Why train/test splits are important
- How regression models generate continuous predictions
- How evaluation metrics help measure model performance

---

## Notes

This was a guided learning project focused on understanding
machine learning fundamentals rather than domain-specific chemistry.

---

## Next Steps

- Rebuild the project independently without tutorial guidance
- Compare multiple regression models
- Apply cross-validation
- Continue building small ML projects to strengthen fundamentals
